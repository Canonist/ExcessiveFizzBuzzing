# ExcessiveFizzBuzzing
This is an artistic interpretation of the classic fizzbuzz. 
It contains a rudimentary menu system, allowing you to choose from a (small) variety of different fizzbuzz options.
It will be expanded, or not.

This code is not optimized - it's an expression of the hacker spirit. Inspired by classic fizzbuzz-tests, but made more entertaining.

Enjoy at your leisure, copy edit, spread and repaste.
